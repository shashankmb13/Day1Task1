Discover open ports on devices in your local network to understand network exposure.





Cyber Security Internship – Task 1

Task: Scan Local Network for Open Ports

Objective

Discover open ports on devices in the local network to understand network exposure and basic reconnaissance techniques.

Tools Used

Nmap (for port scanning)

Wireshark (optional, for packet capture & analysis)

Steps Performed

Installed Nmap from the official website.

Identified local IP range (e.g., 192.168.1.0/24).

Ran a TCP SYN scan using:

nmap -sS 192.168.31.204
Noted down live hosts and their open ports.

Researched common services running on identified ports.

Analyzed possible security risks from exposed ports.

Saved results as a text/HTML file.

Key Learnings

Basics of network reconnaissance.

Understanding open ports and their security implications.

Difference between TCP/UDP scanning.

Role of firewalls in port security.

How Wireshark complements Nmap by analyzing live traffic.

Outcome

✅ Gained hands-on experience in port scanning and network exposure assessment.
